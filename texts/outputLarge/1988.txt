      Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her
      sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow
      on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both

      for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone,
      Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.
