      She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There
      were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently

      herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between

      terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect

      man whom he so justly scorned.
